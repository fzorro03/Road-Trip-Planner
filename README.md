# Road-Trip-Planner

first attempt of building a website that plans road trip based on location choosen.

#Requirements:
    As a user, I should be able to add destinations. I should be able to do this by using a form, click on a map (with an API call), or other approaches included.
    As a user, I should be able to rearrange the order of my destinations.
    As a user, I’d like to be able to see my destinations on a map.
    As a user, I’d like to be able to see information about the distance and journey time between each destination.
    As a user, I’d like to be able to see summary data about my entire journey. This could include the total time, distance and, for extra points, even the fuel needed.
    As a user, I’d like my data to be stored in my browser’s local storage so I can navigate away from this page and come back with the data still there.
